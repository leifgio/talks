# Objectives
At the end of the lesson, you will be able to:

1. reconstruct and modify a program with the use of Python concepts.

--

2. perform file handling operations using Python

--

3. internalize the concept of file handling in general
---
# Files
Are named locations on disk to store related information.

Used to permanently store data in a non-volatile memory.

# Types of Files

## .big-text[Opening Files in Python]
---
.panelset[
.panel[
Python has built-in <mark>**open()**</mark> function to open a file.
.panel-name[Syntax]
```{python, eval=FALSE}
open(file, mode="r")
```
- the *file* parameter is required

- *mode* has a default value of read in text
]

.panel[
```{python, eval=FALSE}
f = open("test.txt") # Open file in relative path
f = open("/home/lab4/test.txt") # Open file in absolute path
```
Let us say we have a ***"test.txt"*** and ***"logo.png"*** in the current directory
.panel-name[Example]
```{python, eval=FALSE}
f = open("test.txt", "w") # write in text mode
print(f)
f = open("logo.png", "rb") # read in binary mode
print(f)
```
]

.panel[
.panel-name[Output]
```{python, eval=FALSE}
<_io.TextIOWrapper name='test.txt' mode='r' encoding='UTF-8'>
<_io.BufferedReader name='input.png'>
```
]

## .big-text[Closing Files in Python]
---
# Always close files
.panelset[
.panel[
.panel-name[Basic]
```{python, eval=FALSE}
f = open("test.txt", "r")
# perform all file operations
f.close()
```
]

.panel[
.panel-name[Safe]
```{python, eval=FALSE}
try:
  f = open("test.txt", "r")
  # perform all file operations
finally:
  f.close
```

]

.panel[
.panel-name[Best]
```{python, eval=FALSE}
with open("test.txt", "r" as f:)
  # perform all file operations
```
]

]
---
# File Object Attributes
.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Attributes]
```{python, eval=FALSE}
file.closed  # returns true if file is closed, false otherwise
file.mode    # returns the access mode with which file was opened
file.name    # returns the name of the file
```

.panel[.panel-name[Usage]
```{python, eval=FALSE}
with open("test.txt", "r") as f:
  print(f.closed)
  print(f.mode) 
  print(f.name)
```
]

.panel[.panel-name[Output]
```{python, eval=FALSE}
False
'r'
'test.txt'
```

## .big-text[Writing Files in Python]
---
.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Modes]
In order to write into a file we need to specify a mode.
```{python, eval=FALSE}
"w" # write mode
"a" # append mode
```
]

.panel[.panel-name[Program 01]
Writing to a file using ***"w"*** mode:
```{python, eval=FALSE}
with open("sample.txt", "w") as f:
  f.write("hello\n")
  f.write("python is awesome")
```
]

.panel[.panel-name[Result 01]
In our file ***"sample.txt"*** we will see:
>hello

>python is awesome

]
.panel[.panel-name[Program 02]
Writing to a file using ***"a"*** mode:
```{python, eval=FALSE}
with open("sample.txt", "a") as f:
  f.write("This will be added to the end of the file")
```
]

.panel[.panel-name[Result 02]
In our file ***"sample.txt"*** we will see:
>hello

>python is awesomeThis will be added to the end of the file

class: center, middle
# Question 01
In **Program 01**, What do you think will happen if ***"sample.txt"*** does not exists in the current directory?
---
class: center, middle
# Answer 01
The program will create a new file named ***"sample.txt"*** in the current directory.
---
class: center, middle
# Question 02
What if there is already an existing file that contains a bunch of string?
---
class: center, middle
# Answer 02
The file will be overwritten.
---
class: center, middle
# Question 03
What is the difference between ***"w"*** and ***"a"*** mode?
---
class: center, middle
# Answer 03
Append mode will add the text at the end of the existing file. While write mode overwrites a file.

## .big-text[Reading Files in Python]
---
.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Methods]
```{python, eval=FALSE}
read(n)     # reads at most n characters from a file.
            # Reads till the end of file if n is None
readline()  # reads and return one line from a file
readlines() # reads and returns a list of lines from a file
```
]

.panel[.panel-name[test.txt]
> hello

>  python is awesome
]

.panel[.panel-name[read()]
To read a file in Python, we must open the file in reading ***"r"*** mode.

Code:
```{python, eval=FALSE}
with open("test.txt", "r") as f:
  message = f.read()
  print(message)
```
Output:
```yaml
hello
python is awesome
```
]

.panel[.panel-name[readline()]
Code:
```{python, eval=FALSE}
with open("test.txt", "r") as f:
  message = f.readline()
  print(message)
```
Output:
```yaml
hello
```
]

.panel[.panel-name[readlines()]
Code:
```{python, eval=FALSE}
with open("test.txt", "r") as f:
  message = f.readlines()
  print(message)
```
Output:
```python
['hello\n', 'python is awesome\n']
```
]
