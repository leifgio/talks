# Objectives
At the end of the lesson, you will be able to:

1. Reconstruct and modify a program with the use of Python concepts.

--

2. Perform file handling operations using Python.

--

3. Internalize the concept of file handling in general.

# Files
Are named locations on disk to store related information.

Used to permanently store data in a non-volatile memory.

## .big-text[Opening Files in Python]
---
.panelset[
.panel[
Python has built-in <mark>**open()**</mark> function to open a file.
.panel-name[Syntax]
```{python, eval=F}
open(file, mode="r")
```
- the *file* parameter is required

- *mode* has a default value of read in text
]

.panel[.panel-name[File Parameter]
```{python, eval=F}
f = open("test.txt") # Open file in relative path
f = open("/home/lab4/test.txt") # Open file in absolute path
```
]

.panel[
.panel-name[File and Mode Parameter]
Let us say we have a ***"test.txt"*** and ***"logo.png"*** in the current directory
.panel-name[Example]
```{python, eval=T}
f = open("test.txt", "r") # read in text mode
print(f)
f = open("logo.png", "rb") # read in binary mode
print(f)
```
]

## .big-text[Closing Files in Python]
---
# Always close files
.panelset[
.panel[
.panel-name[Basic]
```{python, eval=F}
f = open("test.txt", "r")
# perform all file operations
f.close()
```
]

.panel[
.panel-name[Safe]
```{python, eval=F}
try:
  f = open("test.txt", "r")
  # perform all file operations
finally:
  f.close()
```

]

.panel[
.panel-name[Best]
```{python, eval=F}
with open("test.txt", "r") as f:
  # perform all file operations
```
]

]
---
# File Object Attributes
.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Attributes]
```{python,fileAttrib, eval=F}
file.closed  # returns true if file is closed, false otherwise
file.mode    # returns the access mode with which file was opened
file.name    # returns the name of the file
```

.panel[.panel-name[Usage]
  .pull-left[
  What you code:
  ```{python, usage, eval=F}
  with open("test.txt", "r") as f:
    print(f.closed)
    print(f.mode) 
    print(f.name)
  ```
  ]
  
  .pull-right[
  What you get:
  ```{python, usage, echo=F}
  ```

## .big-text[Writing Files in Python]
---
.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Modes & Method]
In order to write into a file we need to specify a mode.
```{python, eval=F}
"w" # write mode
"a" # append mode
```
Writing a string is done using this method:
```{python, eval=F}
write(n)  # The n parameter is the string to be written on the file.
# This will also return the number of characters written to a file.
```
]

.panel[.panel-name[Program 01]
Writing to a file using ***"w"*** mode:
  .pull-left[
  What you code:
  ```{python, program01, eval=F}
  with open("sample.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write("hello\n")
    f.write("python is awesome")
  ```
  ]
  
  .pull-right[
  What you get:
  ```{python, program01, echo=F}
  ```
  ]

]

.panel[.panel-name[Result 01]
In our file ***"sample.txt"*** we will see:
>hello

>python is awesome

]
.panel[.panel-name[Program 02]
Writing to a file using ***"a"*** mode:
```{python, eval=F}
with open("sample.txt", "a") as f:
  f.write("This will be added to the end of the file")
```
]

.panel[.panel-name[Result 02]
In our file ***"sample.txt"*** we will see:
>hello

>python is awesomeThis will be added to the end of the file

# Question 01
In **Program 01**, What do you think will happen if ***"sample.txt"*** does not exists in the current directory?
---
class: center, middle
background-color: #e6f3fc
# Answer 01
The program will create a new file named ***"sample.txt"*** in the current directory.
---

# Question 02
What if there is already an existing file that contains a bunch of string?
---
class: center, middle
background-color: #e6f3fc
# Answer 02
The file will be overwritten.
---

# Question 03
What is the difference between ***"w"*** and ***"a"*** mode?
---
class: center, middle
background-color: #e6f3fc
# Answer 03
Append mode will add the text at the end of the existing file. While write mode overwrites a file.

## .big-text[Reading Files in Python]
---
.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Methods]
```{python, eval=F}
read(n)     # reads at most n characters from a file.
            # Reads till the end of file if n is None
readline()  # reads and return one line from a file
readlines() # reads and returns a list of lines from a file
```
]

.panel[.panel-name[test.txt]
Let us say in our ***"test.txt"*** we have:

> hello

>  python is awesome
]

.panel[.panel-name[read()]
To read a file in Python, we must open the file in reading ***"r"*** mode.

  .pull-left[
  What you code:
  ```{python, read, eval=F}
  with open("test.txt", "r") as f:
    message = f.read()
    print(message)
  ```
  ]

  .pull-right[
  What you get:
  ```{python, read, echo=F}
  ```
  ]
]

.panel[.panel-name[readline()]
  .pull-left[
  What you code:
  ```{python, readline, eval=F}
  with open("test.txt", "r") as f:
    message = f.readline()
    print(message)
  ```
  ]
  
  .pull-right[
  What you get:
  ```{python, readline, echo=F}
  ```
  ]
]

.panel[.panel-name[readlines()]
```{python, readlines, eval=F}
with open("test.txt", "r") as f:
  message = f.readlines()
  print(message)
```
## .center[What is the output?]
]

.panel[.panel-name[Answer]
The output will be a list since readlines returns a list of lines.
```{python, readlines, echo=F}
```

## .big-text[Coding Caesar Cipher]
---
# Parts of the Program
1. Ask user for file name.

2. Ask user for encryption key.

3. Open and read the file.

4. Define a function that encrypts the message.

5. Write the encrypted message to a new file named *"encrypted.txt"*.

```{python, eval=F}
chr((ord(letter) + k - 65) % 26 + 65)
```
---
class: middle, center
background-color: #e6f3fc
# Answer
Change the ***"+"*** operator to ***"-"***.
```{python, eval=F}
chr((ord(letter) - k - 65) % 26 + 65)
