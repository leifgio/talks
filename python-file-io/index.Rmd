# Objectives
At the end of the lesson, you will be able to:

1. Reconstruct and modify a program using programming concepts.

--

2. Perform file handling operations using Python.

--

3. Internalize the concept of file handling in general.

## .big-text[Opening Files in Python]
---
.panelset[
.panel[
Python has built-in <mark>**open()**</mark> function to open a file.
.panel-name[Syntax]
```{python, eval=F}
open(file, mode="r")
```
- the *file* parameter is required

- *mode* has a default value of read in text
]

.panel[
.panel-name[File and Mode Parameter]
Let us say we have a ***"test.txt"*** and ***"logo.png"*** in the current directory
.panel-name[Example]
```{python, eval=F}
f = open("test.txt", "r") # read in text mode
f = open("logo.png", "rb") # read in binary mode
```
]

## .big-text[Closing Files in Python]
---
# Always close files
.panelset[
.panel[
.panel-name[Basic]
```{python, eval=F}
f = open("test.txt", "r")
# perform all file operations
f.close()
```
]

.panel[
.panel-name[Safe]
```{python, eval=F}
try:
  f = open("test.txt", "r")
  # perform all file operations
finally:
  f.close()
```

]

.panel[
.panel-name[Best]
```{python, eval=F}
with open("test.txt", "r") as f:
  # perform all file operations
```
]

]
---
# File Object Attributes
.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Attributes]
```{python,fileAttrib, eval=F}
file.closed  # returns true if file is closed, false otherwise
file.mode    # returns the access mode with which file was opened
file.name    # returns the name of the file
```

.panel[.panel-name[Usage]
  .pull-left[
  What you code:
  ```{python, usage, eval=F}
  with open("test.txt", "r") as f:
    print(f.closed)
    print(f.mode) 
    print(f.name)
  ```
  ]
  
  .pull-right[
  What you get:
  ```{python, usage, echo=F}
  ```

## .big-text[Writing Files in Python]
---
.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Modes & Method]
In order to write into a file we need to specify a mode.
```{python, eval=F}
"w" # write mode
"a" # append mode
```
Writing a string is done using this method:
```{python, eval=F}
write(n)  # The n parameter is the string to be written on the file.
# This will also return the number of characters written to a file.
```
]

.panel[.panel-name[Program]
Writing to a file using ***"w"*** mode:
  .pull-left[
  What you code:
  ```{python, program01, eval=F}
  with open("sample.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write("hello\n")
    f.write("python is awesome")
  ```
  ]
  
  .pull-right[
  What you get:
  ```{python, program01, echo=F}
  ```
  ]

]

.panel[.panel-name[Result]
In our file ***"sample.txt"*** we will see:
>hello

>python is awesome

]

# Question 01
In the **Program**, What do you think will happen if ***"sample.txt"*** does not exists in the current directory?
---
class: center, middle
background-color: #e6f3fc
# Answer 01
The program will create a new file named ***"sample.txt"*** in the current directory.
---
class: center, middle
background-color: #e6f3fc
# Question 02
What if there is already an existing file that contains a bunch of string?
---
class: center, middle
background-color: #e6f3fc
# Answer 02
The file will be overwritten.
---
class: center, middle
background-color: #e6f3fc
# Question 03
What is the difference between ***"w"*** and ***"a"*** mode?
---
class: center, middle
background-color: #e6f3fc
# Answer 03
Append mode will add the text at the end of the existing file. While write mode overwrites a file.

## .big-text[Reading Files in Python]
---
.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Methods]
```{python, eval=F}
read(n)     # reads at most n characters from a file.
            # Reads till the end of file if n is None
readline()  # reads and return one line from a file
readlines() # reads and returns a list of lines from a file
```
]

.panel[.panel-name[test.txt]
Let us say in our ***"test.txt"*** we have:

> hello

>  python is awesome
]

.panel[.panel-name[read()]
To read a file in Python, we must open the file in reading ***"r"*** mode.

  .pull-left[
  What you code:
  ```{python, read, eval=F}
  with open("test.txt", "r") as f:
    message = f.read()
    print(message)
  ```
  ]

  .pull-right[
  What you get:
  ```{python, read, echo=F}
  ```
  ]
]

.panel[.panel-name[readline()]
  .pull-left[
  What you code:
  ```{python, readline, eval=F}
  with open("test.txt", "r") as f:
    message = f.readline()
    print(message)
  ```
  ]
  
  .pull-right[
  What you get:
  ```{python, readline, echo=F}

## .big-text[Coding Caesar Cipher]
---
# Parts of the Program
1. Ask user for file name.

2. Ask user for encryption key.

3. Open and read the file.

4. Define a function that encrypts the message using the encryption key.

5. Define a function that writes the encrypted message to a new file named *"encrypted.txt"*.
---
## Step 1 and 2
```{python, eval=F}
# Ask User for file name
fileName = input("Enter the file name: ")
# Ask user for encryption key
key = int(input("Enter encrpytion key: "))
```
## Step 3
```{python, eval=F}
# Open and read the file
with open(fileName) as f:
  message = f.read().strip()
```
---
## Step 4
```{python, eval=F}
# Define a function that encrypts
# the message using the encryption key.
def encrypt(msg, k):
    newText = ""
    for letter in msg:
        if letter.isupper():
            newText += chr((ord(letter) + k - 65) % 26 + 65)
        elif letter.islower():
            newText += chr((ord(letter) + k - 97) % 26 + 97)
        else:
            newText += letter
    return newText
```
---
## Step 5
```{python, eval=F}
# Define a function that writes the encrypted
# message to a new file named "encrypted.txt".
def writeFile(msg):
    with open("encrypted.txt","w") as f:
        f.write(msg)
```
## Finally
```{python, eval=F}
# Use the code all together
encryptedText = encrypt(message, key)
writeFile(encryptedText)
```

What will you modify in the program to decipher the message?
```{python, eval=F}
chr((ord(letter) + k - 65) % 26 + 65)
```
---

background-color: #e6f3fc
# Answer
Change the ***"+"*** operator to ***"-"***.
