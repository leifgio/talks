# Learning Outcomes

1. Develop a product-oriented performance-based task based on given competencies

2. Design a product-oriented performance-based task according to field of specialization.

3. Create scoring rubrics in evaluating outputs of product-oriented performance-based assessment; 

4. Develop assessment tasks of product-oriented performance-based assessment

---

# Presentation of Content

In giving authentic assessment, one type of assessment that requires the students to demonstrate skills and knowledge that are relevant in real-life situations is performance assessment.

Performance assessment is a direct and systematic observation of the actual performances of the students based from a pre-determined performance criterion (Zimmaro, 2003). It is an alternative form of assessment that asks learners to perform a task applying the knowledge they have gained from a unit or units of study. These assessments are typically open-ended, complex and authentic (Lund and Kirk, 2019). 

---

# Performance Assessment

One in which a teacher observes and makes a
judgment about the student’s demonstration
of a skill or competency in creating a
product, constructing a response, or making a
presentation.

Emphasis on student’s ability to perform tasks
by producing their own work with their
knowledge and skills.

---

# Benefits of Performance Assessment

The use of their higher order thinking skills in creating a process or a product is required in method of evaluation (Chun, 2010). Learning tasks are beyond rote memorization; thus, letting the students apply, analyze and create. The National Capital Language Resource Center (NCLRC, 2011) listed criteria that make a performance task authentic.

---

# What makes authentic performance tasks?

Be built around topics or issues of interest to the students;

- Replicate real-world communication contexts and
situations;

- Involve multi-stage tasks and real problems that require creative use of language rather than simple repetition;

- Require learners to produce a quality product or
performance:

- Evaluation criteria and standards are known to the
students;

- Involve interaction between assessor (instructor, peers, self) and person assessed; and

- Allow for self-evaluation and self-correction as students proceed.

# Process-Oriented Performance-Based Assessment

Process-oriented performance-based assessment is concerned with the actual task performance rather than the output or product of the activity. It assesses and
observes the procedures and experiences of the students in achieving the learning outcomes.

It requires a step-by-step interaction between the student and the teacher. Thus, it is expected that during the process, the student can commit mistakes and the teacher corrects the errors of the learners. With the use of this type of assessment, the students will help them achieve best output

---

# Process-Oriented Learning Competencies

Competencies are defined as groups of knowledge. skills,
and attitudes needed to achieve a certain task. These
competencies should be transferable, observable, and
accessible to the students.

- are expressed in direct observable behaviors of the students

- focus on the behaviors that demonstrate “best
practice” for the specific task or activity.

---

# Product-Oriented Performance-Based Assessment

- A kind of assessment wherein the assessor views and scores the final product made and not on the actual process of making that product.

- It is concerned on the product alone and not on the process. It is focused to the outcome or the performance output of the learner. It also focuses on the achievement of the learner.

- P-OPBA focuses on evaluating the result or outcome of a process.

---

# Product-Oriented Learning Competencies

#### Student Performances
defined as targeted tasks that lead to a product or overall learning outcome

#### Target Tasks
behavior expectations targeting complex tasks that students are expected to achieve

#### Products or Outputs
linked with an assessment of the level of expertise manifested by the product

---
# Product-Oriented Learning Competencies

**Target at least three levels:**

1. Beginner

2. Skilled

3. Expert

---

# Learning Competencies

Are defined as groups or clusters of skills and abilities needed for a particular task

The objectives focus on the behaviors which excemplify "best practice" for particular task

Such behavior range from a "beginner" up to the level of "expert"

---

# Examples

#### Task
Recite a Poem by Edgar Allan Poe, "The Raven"

#### Objectives
To enable the students to recite a poem entitled "The Raven" by Edgar Allan Poe

Specifically:

1. Recite the poem from memory without referring to notes;

2. Use appropriate hand and body gestures in delivering the
piece;

3. Maintain eye contact with the audience while reciting the
poem;

4. Create ambiance of the poem through appropriate rising and
falling intonation;

5. Pronounce the words clearly and with proper diction.

---

# Examples of Competencies

.pull-left[
#### Simple Competencies
- Speak with a well-modulated voice

- Draw a straight line from one point to another point

- Color a leaf with green crayon
]

.pull-right[
#### Complex Competencies
- Recite a poem with feeling using appropriate voice quality, facial expression and hand gestures

- Construct an equilateral triangle given three non-collinear points

- Draw and color a leaf with green crayon

]

# Task Designing

The design of the task in this context depends on what the teacher desires to observe as outputs of the students.

- Complexity – the level of complexity of the
project needs to be within the range of ability
of the students.

- Appeal – the project or activity must be
interesting enough to the students.

- Creativity – the project needs to encourage
students to exercise creativity and divergent
thinking.

- Goal-based – always bear in mind that the
project is produced to attain a learning
objective.

---

# Task Designing

Performance task requires the students to construct a response, usually
complex in nature. Performance tasks usually emulate actual workplace
activities or real-life skill applications and require higher order processing
skills. Performance tasks may be individual or group-oriented. Each
performance task contained in the bank is designed to elicit a response on
the part of the student that serves as evidence of attainment of the
benchmark. It is important to remember that the types of tasks we suggest
have been dictated by the benchmarks

When designing assessment tasks, teachers should always remember that
the purpose of the tasks is to provide opportunities for students to
demonstrate what they have achieved or learned. Hence, it is essential to
determine the learning competencies to be exhibited by the students. Then,
the learning competencies will be the basis of the teachers in designing
tasks.

---

# Choosing Task Criteria by Boud(1998)

The task is **authentic** and set in a **realistic context** (i.e., oriented towards the world external to the course itself)

They are **worthwhile** learning activities in their own right.

The assessments permit a **holistic** rather than a fragmented approach

The tasks are not repetitive for either student or assessor - they should work as a **productive use of time** for all those involved.

---

# Choosing Task Criteria by Boud(1998)

The assessment **prompts student self-assessment**.

The tasks are sufficiently **flexible** for students to tailor them to
their own needs and interests

The assessment is not likely to be **interpreted** by students in a
way fundamentally different to that of the designer

The task does not make **assumptions** about the subject matter or the
learner which are **differentially perceived** by different groups of students,
and which are irrelevant to the task

---

# Example

#### Topic 
Lesson Planning

#### Outcome 
Students will be able to develop lessons reflective of different learning styles and Gardner's Theory of Multiple Intelligences

#### Task
- Divide students into eight groups

- Assign Each Group one of the eight intelligence

- They can select specific content and grade/year level of the students they are preparing the lesson for

- The Lesson Plan will be graded according to the rubrics

---

# Exercise

Give an example of a product-oriented performance task in the chat box

#### Topic:

# Scoring Rubrics

A coherent set of criteria for students' work that includes descriptions of levels of performance quality on the criteria

A descriptive scoring schemes developed by teachers or other educators to guide the analyses of the **processes** or **products** of students' efforts(Brookhart, 1999)

Rubric is a scoring scale used to assess student performance along a task-specific set of criteria.

---

# Descriptors

Descriptors spell out what is expected of students at each level of performance for each criterion

It tells students what performance looks like at each level and how their work distinguished from the work of others for each criterion

---

# Why include levels of performance?

1. Clearer expectations

2. More consistent and objective assessment

3. Better feedback

4. Analytic versus holistic rubrics

---

# Example of Analytic Scoring Rubric

---

# How to use Analytic Rubric

&lt;iframe width="1100" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yVY6CDWaxoo?start=246&amp;end=417" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

---

# Example of Holistic Rubric

&lt;iframe width="1100" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yVY6CDWaxoo?start=417&amp;end=499" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

---

# How to use Holistic Rubric

&lt;iframe width="1100" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yVY6CDWaxoo?start=499&amp;end=547" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;


---

# When to choose an analytic rubric?

For assignments that involve a larger number of
criteria

---

# When to use holistic rubric?

- When a quick or gross judgment needs to be made

- If the assignment is a minor one such as brief
assignment (e.g. check, check-plus, or no check)
to quickly review student work.

---

# How many levels of performance?

- No specific number of levels

- Will vary depending on the task and your needs

- Start with at least three levels and then expand if necessary.

---

# Purpose of Rubrics

Rubrics fit well into any kind of course delivery. In regards to online teaching, they fit in very well. The reason is because students can view the rubric for the assignment or project, and then immediately know what is expected of them to get thegrade they want. Any questions the student may have is usually answered through the rubric. Students can begin on their project right away and not have to wait for the instructor to answer their question through email or discussion boards. 

---

# Developing Rubrics

1. What is the purpose of
the rubric?

2. What type of rubric do you prefer to use

3. What are your criteria?

4. What is your rating scale?

5. Does your rubric have descriptors?

---

# Benefits of using rubrics

The benefits of using rubrics in courses can be observed by both instructors and students. According to
Suskie (2009, p. 139), rubrics:

- Help clarify vague, fuzzy goals.

- Help students understand your expectations.

- Help students self-improve.

- Inspire better student performance.

- Make scoring easier and faster.

- Make scoring more accurate, unbiased, and consistent.

- Improve feedback to students.

- Reduce arguments with students.

- Improve feedback to faculty and staff

---

# Possible Disadvantages of Rubrics

- Development of rubrics can be complex and time-consuming

- Using the correct language to express performance expectation can be difficult

- Defining the correct set of criteria to define performance can be complex

---

# Exercise

Identify whether the task is process-oriented or product oriented learning competencies

1. Constructing an angle using straight edge and a compass

2. Writing an essay about EDSA 1

3. Performing a play on the importance of national language

4. Role to illustrate the concept of Filipino family values
 
5. Constructing three-dimensional models of solids from card boards
