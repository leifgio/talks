# Objectives
At the end of the lesson, you will be able to:

1. Know the characteristics of Javascript variables.

--

2. Perform the declaration of variables and basic arithmetic using Javascript.

--

3. Internalize the concept of variables in programming.
---

# Variable Declaration Syntax
.medium-text[*keyword – identifier – assignment operator – value;*]
---
# Four Ways to Declare a Javascript Variable
- Using **var**

- Using **let**

- Using **const**

- Using nothing
---
# Characteristics of Variable Identifier/Name
- Case sensitive

- Must beign with a letter, “$”, or “_”

- Name can contain letters, digits, “$”, and “_"

- Space is not allowed in variable identifiers/name

- Javascript keywords cannot be used as identifier/name
---
# Javascript Assignment Operator

In Javascript, the equal sign ( = ) is an "assignment" operator. This  is  different  in  algebra  where  the  equal  sign  is  "equal  to" operator.
---
# Javascript Values
- Values can hold numbers and text values.

- In programming, text values are called string.

- Strings are written inside double quotes while numbers are
written without quotes
---
# Undefined Value
In computer program, variables are often declared without value. The
value can be something that has to be calculated, or something will
be provided later, like user input.

A variable declared without a value will have the value undefined.
---
# Javascript Arithmetic
The  same  with  algebra,  you  can  do  arithmetic  with  javascript
variables, using arithmetic operators ( +, -, /, * ).
---
# Follow-up Assignment

Plan and conceptualize a Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator program.You only need to identify all the variables needed in the program.

Write your answers on a sheet of yellow pad, including your name and section on the top of the paper.

**Deadline:** Friday, March 17, 2023 until 4:59pm only.
---
# Advance Assingment

Search the difference of const with var and let. Keeep your answers short, up to one paragraph only.

The task will be assigned on Google Classroom. You only need to comment your answers.

Submission of assignment is on Friday March 17, 2023, until 5:59 pm only.
